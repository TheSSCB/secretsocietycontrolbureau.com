Congratulations. You found our webpage. The SSCB congratulates you.

The Secret Society Control Bureau (SSCB) was created to help catalog and control small secret societies. 
It has several members, but the names are classified.

A list of societies the SSCB has catalogged:
The Shadowwalkers,
Brothers in Darkness,
The Listeners,
Umbra,
Lightmen, and
Doomsday.

Societies currently being investigated:
Brickmen,
Undergrounders,
The Enlightened Ones,
Occulta Apparentia,
Sisters in Shadows,
Brothers in Shadows,
Invisibilia Sumus, and
Matchstick.

A message for all the small societies: We are not here to shut you down. We are here to help you, and make sure you don't overstep your power or ideas into dangerous territory. However, we must say this: Be warned. The SSCB will find you if you create a secret society. But, as we said before, we are here to help.
